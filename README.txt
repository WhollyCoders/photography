	Overview:

		- Item: A generic container of stuff. Said stuff can be a thumbnail, the actual
		  page header, or whatever else you deem item worthy. Items can vary in width but
		  are all the same height (230px by default, but you can change this with a setting).

		- Thumb: A special type of item that contains a thumbnail image and a title. Short
		  for thumbnail. No relation to actual nails.

		- Reel: A whole bunch of items strung together, and the main point of interaction
		  for users.





	Notes:

		- Scrolling is handled in 3 ways:

			1. Scrolling up/down using the mouse wheel (down = scroll right, up = scroll left)
			2. Using the left/right arrow keys ("Scroll Keys")
			3. Moving the mouse cursor to the far left or far right of the screen ("Scroll Zones")

			Methods #2 and #3 can be disabled and customized using settings (below). Method #1
			is always enabled.

		- If you don't have enough items to require scrolling, the reel will just be centered on
		  the screen.

		- Rows will automatically factor when the viewport is resized.

		- All modern desktop/mobile browsers are supported (as well as IE as far back as 8, though
		  7 is still pretty usable).
